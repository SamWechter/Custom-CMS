      <title>Many many updates!</title>
      <description>I'm done with setting up the advertisements page and its associated admin section now. Additionally, styling has been adjusted across multiple pages to make the site look better overall. I'm now working on a banner maintenance section on the admin page to allow admins to select what banners will be shown in the rotation.</description>
