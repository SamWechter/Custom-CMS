Base requirements
	- I believe I have met all of the base requirements for this project
	- I created the "Sam Wechter News" logo in Adobe Illustrator and included the .ai file 
		in my project submission
	- All of the banners were pulled from the internet
		- I wanted to create custom banners with links to their associated websites but was not 
			able to due to time constraints
		- Sources for the banners are as follows: 
			- Banner 1: http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/?attachment_id=5657
				- This is the red banner with yellow "PLACE HOLDER" text
			- Banner 2: http://nationalcenterforhomeopathy.org/content/banner-placeholder-1
				- This is the white banner with green "Banner Ad Placeholder #1" text
			- Banner 3: http://dynaserve.net/moderndogs/moderndogs_template/template.html
				- This is the small gray banner with black "Banner Image X 9" text
	- The code is fully commented
		- If anything is unclear just email me and I'll gladly explain it
Extras: 
	- Contact Us Form
		- Located at Project1/contact.php
		- Borrows some code from my submission for 539 homework 2
		- Validates fields on form submission
			- Validates the input email to make sure it is a valid address
	- Meaningful news items
		- At least 11 news items are related to me or the project and are NOT placeholders
		- Most of the news items are project updates that I posted while creating the project
			 - Several other items are project-related
		- One news item is about the startup company I am working with, Appture LLC
		- Another news item includes a link to my coursework from Client-Side Programming
		- I have left in several placeholder news items only for the purpose of demonstrating page limiting and 
			navigation in news.php
			- These news items have "test" in their name or are filled with lorem ipsum text
	- Allow user to choose number of news items per page with navigation adjusted accordingly
		- news.php has a select input that allows the visitor to choose between showing 5, 10, 20, or 50 news items 
			per page
		- Page navigation will update to reflect the new number of pages based on the amount of news items per page
		- The visitor's selection will be remembered between pages
		- I achieved this through a script element containing JavaScript that I appended to the DOM
	- Design/Navigation extras
		- I created and designed two additional pages over the base requirements (contact.php and about.php)
			- I also added both to the navigation bar
