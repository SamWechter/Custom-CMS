This project was created as my Project 2 for Web Server Side Programming (4002-536-02) during the Spring quarter of the 2012-2013 academic year at RIT.
Almost all of the code was created by myself (Sam Wechter) other than specific sections of PHP provided by professor Dean Ganskop.
Almost all of the images used in this project are placeholders because the project's grading was solely focused on programming.

Requirements for this project included:
	- A customized Content Management System
	- A PHP templating system
	- An admin panel to update, change, or add new content
	- Automatically generated RSS feeds based on newly added content
	- Functionality to load and parse classmates' RSS feeds
	- A contact page that visitors can use to automatically email me without the need to open an email client
	- The creation and use of PHP classes
