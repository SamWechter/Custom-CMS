This was created as my Project 2 for Web Server Side Programming during the Spring 2013 quarter at RIT.

Almost all of the code was created by myself other than specific sections of PHP provided by professor Dean Ganskop which are primarily located in LIB_project1.php. Most of professor Ganskop's code involved examples of PHP string sanitization and validation functions.

Most of the images used in this project are placeholders because the project's grading was solely focused on programming.

Requirements for this project included:
	- A customized Content Management System
	- A PHP templating system
	- An admin panel to add new and update existing content
	- An automatically generated RSS feed based on newly added content
	- Functionality to load and parse classmates' and other RSS feeds
	- A contact page that visitors can use to automatically email me
	- The creation and use of PHP classes
